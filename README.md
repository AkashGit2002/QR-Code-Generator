What Is a Quick Response (QR) Code? A quick response (QR) code is a type of barcode that can be read easily by a digital device and which stores information as a series of pixels in a square-shaped grid. QR codes are frequently used to track information about products in a supply chain and often used in marketing and advertising campaigns.
